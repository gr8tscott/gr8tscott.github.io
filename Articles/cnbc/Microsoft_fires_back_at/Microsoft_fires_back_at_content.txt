But your letter and Delta's public comments are incomplete, false, misleading, and damaging to Microsoft and its reputation, he said.Microsoft's letter followed a similar one from CrowdStrike on Sunday rejecting claims from the Atlanta-based airline. Cheffo wrote that Microsoft offered to help Delta for free. Each day from July 19 to July 23, Microsoft employees said they could help, but Delta turned them away, according to the letter.Delta CEO Bastian told CNBC's Squawk Box that CrowdStrike didn't offer any financial compensation but did extend free consulting advice on dealing with the fallout from the outage. watch nowVIDEO6:3406:34Delta Air Lines CEO on CrowdStrike outage: Cost us half a billion dollars in five daysSquawk BoxMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella emailed Bastian, who has never replied, Cheffo wrote Tuesday. CrowdStrike also said its CEO George Kurtz had reached out to his counterpart at Delta but received no response.Cheffo described a letter on July 22, from Microsoft to a Delta employee, offering help. The Delta employee wrote back: All good. Cool will let you know and thank you.Delta executives said the outage, which led to more cancellations than in all of 2019, overwhelmed its crew-scheduling platform that matches crews to flights. But Cheffo said Delta doesn't rely on Windows or Microsoft's Azure cloud services.In 2021, IBM announced a multiyear deal with Delta to help it implement a hybrid-cloud architecture running on Red Hat's OpenShift software. In 2022, Amazon said Delta had picked the digital commerce company's Amazon Web Services unit to be its preferred cloud provider.It is rapidly becoming apparent that Delta likely refused Microsoft's help because the IT system it was most having trouble restoring — its crew-tracking and scheduling system — was being serviced by other technology providers, such as IBM, because it runs on those providers' systems, and not Microsoft Windows or Azure, Cheffo wrote in his letter.Bastian said last week Delta had to manually reset 40,000 servers.Microsoft demands that Delta retain records showing how much technologies from IBM, Amazon and others contributed to the airline's issues from July 19 to July 24, Cheffo wrote. Spokespeople for IBM and Amazon didn't immediately provide comment.Bastian told CNBC last week, If you're going to be having access, priority access, to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you've got to test this stuff. You can't come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. It doesn't work.
